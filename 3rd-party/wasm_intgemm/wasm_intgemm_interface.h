/** Main interface for integer matrix multiplication followed by addition of bias for wasm.
 *
 * C = A * B + Bias
 *
 * Input matrix A:
 *   - is a 2-D matrix that typically represents activations as floating point values
 *   - no. of rows should be a multiple of 1 (i.e. no restriction)
 *   - no. of columns should be a multiple of 64
 *   - is represented as array (contiguous memory locations) in row-major format
 *
 * Input matrix B:
 *   - is a 2-D matrix that typically represents fixed model parameters as floating point values
 *   - no. of rows should be:
 *     -- equal to no. of columns of Input matrix A
 *     -- a multiple of 64
 *   - no. of columns should be a multiple of 8
 *   - is represented as array (contiguous memory locations) in row-major format
 *
 *   Please note that it is also possible to pass Input matrix B in 2 more forms:
 *    - One that is already a quantized and transposed version of Input matrix B
 *    - Other that is already a transposed version of Input matrix B
 *
 * Input Bias:
 *   - is an array (contiguous memory locations) that represents bias
 *   - size of the array should be equal to the no. of columns of Input matrix B
 *
 * Output matrix C:
 *   - is a 2-D matrix that represents the result (= A * B + Bias)
 *   - no. of rows will be equal to no. of rows of Input matrix A
 *   - no. of columns will be equal to no. of columns of Input matrix B (in untransposed form)
 *   - is represented as array (contiguous memory locations) in row-major format
 *
 * Please note that most of the functions in this interface might have architecture specific
 * implementations.
 *
 * Conventions followed throughout this file:
 *  - Unless explicitly mentioned, Input matrix B always means an unquantized (i.e. float values)
 *    and non-transposed version
 *  - no. of rows of Input matrix A = `rows_A`
 *  - no. of columns of Input matrix A = no. of rows of Input matrix B = `width`
 *  - no. of columns of Input matrix B = `cols_B`
